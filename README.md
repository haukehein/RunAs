#A modified version of phusion/passenger-customizable

This is a modified version of https://github.com/haukehein/Admin-Batch_Clone

There's nothing wrong with the Admin-Batch_Clone (it's really good!). This contains some modifications (updates) because I personally find useful. Admin-Batch_Clone is a clone of Admin-Batch (http://www.itninja.com/blog/view/batch-run-as-administrator-automatically-with-highest-privileges-by-tools-batch-admin)

### runas_admin.cmd

The batch file executes a command (or an .exe-file) along with arguments using administrator privileges.


### runas_system.cmd

The batch file executes a command (or an .exe-file) along with arguments using system privileges(!).


### admindo.cmd

This is a renamed and modified version of earlier admin-batch.bat file.
